# Appendix 2. Covariate details

We evaluated biophysical covariates (Table 2.1) expected to influence the distribution, abundance, and movements of sea ducks or, more likely, the distribution and availability of their benthic prey (e.g., mollusks and crustaceans); we did not have information related directly to the distribution of preferred prey.  Biophysical covariates could be characterized as strictly spatial or temporal effects (i.e., varying only among segments or within or among winters, respectively) or as spatiotemporal effects (i.e., varying among segments and within or among winters). We allowed the effect of bathymetry and relative sea surface temperature to vary over time within a given winter via interactions with day of season.  We also included a survey effort covariate and covariates that s that served as We standardized (i.e., mean centered and scaled) all continuous covariates.  Appendix 3 describes and illustrates the use of an R function to visualize the spatial and temporal distribution of these covariates in Nantucket Sound.

**Table 2.1** Biophysical and survey covariates used to evaluate the distribution and abundance of Common Eider, Black, Surf, and White-winged Scoter, and Long-tailed Duck in Nantucket Sound during winters 2003 - 2005. Variable type indicates whether an effect was spatial (S), temporal (T), or spatiotemporal (ST) during the study period (see Covariates section of text).
