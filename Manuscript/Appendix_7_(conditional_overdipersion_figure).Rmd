![Sea duck conditional overdispersion](./Figures/conditional_abundance_maps_reduced.png)  
**Figure 7.1.** Median (first row) and median absolute deviation (MAD; second row) of Common Eider (COEI), scoter (SCOT), and Long-tailed Duck (LTDU) conditional overdispersion (i.e., given sea duck presence) predicted at 10 dates evenly-spaced from 15 November and 1 April in three winters (2003 - 2005) of aerial surveys in Nantucket Sound.  Predicted values are categorized based on their quartiles; segments with predictions $\geq$ 98th percentile are outlined. Conditional abundance values represent the expected number of sea ducks, conditional on their presence, in a 1.5 km x ca. 180 m transect through the segment.
