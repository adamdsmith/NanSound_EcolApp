  abstract = {The European wintering population of Greater Scaup has declined significantly over the last 20 years and some of the main threats appear to be at the wintering grounds. This contribution aims at describing the local distribution of Scaup in the Dutch Wadden Sea, one of the most important wintering sites for Scaup in relation to available food resources. Data on the distribution of Scaup was obtained from annual aerial counts in January during 1999–2009. This data was related to benthos data of regular shellfish surveys in the sublittoral part of the western Dutch Wadden Sea. Boosted regression tree models were applied to quantify the relative importance of different potential prey items to explain the presence of Scaup. Scaup preferred sites with high abundances of small sized Mya arenaria. A negative influence on Scaup preference for sites with high abundances M. arenaria was found when there was a high abundance of large Cerastoderma edule at the sites, which increased Scaup searching time for M. arenaria.},

The primary objective of this study was to develop a spatially explicit abundance model of wintering common loons in the maritime waters of southern New England (USA) that could inform decisions about offshore development. Aerial line-transect surveys were conducted throughout a 3800 km2 study area off the coast of Rhode Island during the winters of 2010–2011 and 2011–2012. A density surface model (DSM) approach was used to account for imperfect detection and incorporate spatially explicit environmental covariates. Common loon densities were greatest in waters \ensuremath{<}35 m deep, with high chl a surface concentrations (\ensuremath{>}2 mg m-3). The DSM predicted 5047 (95\% CI = 3993-6379) common loons in the study area during winter, which suggests this region provides key habitat for this species in eastern North America. This study highlights important areas for common loons in the region, suggests key biotic (primary productivity as measured by long-term chl a surface concentrations) and abiotic covariates (water depth) driving the spatial distribution and abundance of common loons in southern New England, and identifies sites that should be considered for protection from offshore development, including offshore wind facilities.},

  abstract = {Abstract
There are currently no offshore wind energy developments (OWEDs) in North America, although numerous OWEDs have been proposed along the Atlantic Coast. Development pressure has been a catalyst for marine spatial planning (MSP) to identify suitable areas for OWED. However, integrating complex ecological information to guide OWED siting remains a substantial challenge. We developed spatial distribution models of marine birds from aerial surveys that we conducted from 2010 to 2012 throughout a 3800 km2 area off the coast of Rhode Island. For seven groups of marine birds, we constructed either a density surface model or a presence–absence model that incorporated relevant environmental covariates. We integrated our spatial models, along with uncertainty, using spatial conservation prioritization (SCP) software. This identified sites with high marine bird conservation priority that aided evaluation of proposed OWED sites. We found that shallow nearshore waters had the highest conservation priority overall, but we also detected key offshore areas of high priority. Hypothetical OWEDs placed in conservation priority areas significantly reduced the overall distribution of focal species. Currently proposed OWED sites are located in areas of relatively low conservation priority and so would not substantially reduce the overall distribution of marine birds. This SCP approach when combined with quantitative models of bird distribution given relevant environmental covariates provides a robust framework that satisfies the principles of ecosystem-based MSP. Thus, this combined SCP-distribution modeling framework should be extremely helpful to decision makers as they evaluate proposed siting locations of OWEDs in the context of a dynamic marine system.},

  abstract = {Twelve species of North American sea ducks (Tribe Mergini) winter off the eastern coast of the United States and Canada. Yet, despite their seasonal proximity to urbanized areas in this region, there is limited information on patterns of wintering sea duck habitat use. It is difficult to gather information on sea ducks because of the relative inaccessibility of their offshore locations, their high degree of mobility, and their aggregated distributions. To characterize environmental conditions that affect wintering distributions, as well as their geographic ranges, we analyzed count data on five species of sea ducks (black scoters Melanitta nigra americana, surf scoters M. perspicillata, white-winged scoters M. fusca, common eiders Somateria mollissima, and long-tailed ducks Clangula hyemalis) that were collected during the Atlantic Flyway Sea Duck Survey for ten years starting in the early 1990s. We modeled count data for each species within ten-nautical-mile linear survey segments using a zero-inflated negative binomial model that included four local-scale habitat covariates (sea surface temperature, mean bottom depth, maximum bottom slope, and a variable to indicate if the segment was in a bay or not), one broad-scale covariate (the North Atlantic Oscillation), and a temporal correlation component. Our results indicate that species distributions have strong latitudinal gradients and consistency in local habitat use. The North Atlantic Oscillation was the only environmental covariate that had a significant (but variable) effect on the expected count for all five species, suggesting that broad-scale climatic conditions may be directly or indirectly important to the distributions of wintering sea ducks. Our results provide critical information on species–habitat associations, elucidate the complicated relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation, sea surface temperature, and local sea duck abundances, and should be useful in assessing the impacts of climate change on seabirds.},

FVCOM captures the near-resonant nature of the semidiurnal tide and energy flux in the GoM and the complex dynamics governing the tide in the NES. Stratification has limited impact on tidal elevation, but can significantly modify the tidal current profile. Internal tides are energetic in the stratified regions over steep bottom topography, but their contribution to the total tidal energy flux is only significant over the northeast flank of Georges Bank. The model suggests that the tidal flushing-induced eddy east of Monomoy Island is the dynamic basis for the locally observed phase lead of the M2 tide. The southward propagating tidal wave east of Cape Cod encounters the northeastward propagating tidal wave from the NES south of Nantucket Island, forming a zone of minimum sea level along a southeast-oriented line from Nantucket Island. These two waves are characterized by linear dynamics in which bottom friction and advection are negligible in the momentum balance, but their superposition leads to a strong nonlinear current interaction and large bottom stress in the zone of lowest sea elevation.},

  abstract = {The distribution of predators is widely recognized to be intimately linked to the distribution of their prey. Foraging theory suggests that predators will modify their behaviors, including movements, to optimize net energy intake when faced with variation in prey attributes or abundance. While many studies have documented changes in movement patterns of animals in response to temporal changes in food, very few have contrasted movements of a single predator species naturally occurring in dramatically different prey landscapes. We documented variation in the winter movements, foraging range size, site fidelity, and distribution patterns of a molluscivorous sea duck, the surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), in two areas of coastal British Columbia with very different shellfish prey features. Baynes Sound has extensive tidal flats with abundant clams, which are high-quality and temporally stable prey for scoters. Malaspina Inlet is a rocky fjord-like inlet where scoters consume mussels that are superabundant and easily accessible in some patches but are heavily depleted over the course of winter. We used radio telemetry to track surf scoter movements in both areas and found that in the clam habitats of Baynes Sound, surf scoters exhibited limited movement, small winter ranges, strong foraging site fidelity, and very consistent distribution patterns. By contrast, in mussel habitats in the Malaspina Inlet, surf scoters displayed more movement, larger ranges, little fidelity to specific foraging sites, and more variable distribution patterns. We conclude that features associated with the different prey types, particularly the higher depletion rates of mussels, strongly influenced seasonal space use patterns. These findings are consistent with foraging theory and confirm that predator behavior, specifically movements, is environmentally mediated.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are undergoing rapid change at local and global scales. To understand these changes, including the relative roles of natural variability and anthropogenic effects, and to predict the future state of marine ecosystems requires quantitative understanding of the physics, biogeochemistry and ecology of oceanic systems at mechanistic levels. Central to this understanding is the role played by dominant patterns or “modes” of atmospheric and oceanic variability, which orchestrate coherent variations in climate over large regions with profound impacts on ecosystems. We review the spatial structure of extratropical climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere and, specifically, focus on modes of climate variability over the extratropical North Atlantic.
A leading pattern of weather and climate variability over the Northern Hemisphere is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO refers to a redistribution of atmospheric mass between the Arctic and the subtropical Atlantic, and swings from one phase to another producing large changes in surface air temperature, winds, storminess and precipitation over the Atlantic as well as the adjacent continents. The NAO also affects the ocean through changes in heat content, gyre circulations, mixed layer depth, salinity, high latitude deep water formation and sea ice cover. Thus, indices of the NAO have become widely used to document and understand how this mode of variability alters the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems.
There is no unique way, however, to define the NAO. Several approaches are discussed including both linear (e.g., principal component analysis) and nonlinear (e.g., cluster analysis) techniques. The former, which have been most widely used, assume preferred atmospheric circulation states come in pairs, in which anomalies of opposite polarity have the same spatial structure. In contrast, nonlinear techniques search for recurrent patterns of a specific amplitude and sign. They reveal, for instance, spatial asymmetries between different phases of the NAO that are likely important for ecological studies.
It also follows that there is no universally accepted index to describe the temporal evolution of the NAO. Several of the most common measures are presented and compared. All reveal that there is no preferred time scale of variability for the NAO: large changes occur from one winter to the next and from one decade to the next. There is also a large amount of within-season variability in the patterns of atmospheric circulation of the North Atlantic, so that most winters cannot be characterized solely by a canonical NAO structure. A better understanding of how the NAO responds to external forcing, including sea surface temperature changes in the tropics, stratospheric influences, and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, is crucial to the current debate on climate variability and change.},

  abstract = {The southern New England continental shelf is an important region for black scoters (Melanitta americana) during winter and migratory staging periods and a priority area for developing offshore wind energy facilities. However, little is known about the migration phenology and habitat use of black scoters in this portion of their range and this information is necessary to assess potential risks to black scoters during the marine spatial planning process. In this regional black scoter study over 2 winters, we used satellite telemetry and spatial modeling techniques to estimate migratory timing and length of stay, quantify winter home range size and site fidelity between winters, examine key habitat characteristics associated with core-use areas, and map relative probabilities of use across a 3,800-km2 marine spatial planning area for 2 proposed offshore renewable energy facilities. Black scoters spent nearly 5 months in southern New England, with wide variation among individuals in the size of winter utilization distributions (range 16–12,367 km2). Approximately 50\% of the tagged birds returned to southern New England during the subsequent winter and had variable fidelity to core-use areas occupied the previous winter. During both winters, black scoter core-use areas were located closer to shore, at shallower water depths, with coarser sediment grain size and higher probability of hard-bottom occurrence relative to available areas. Resource selection functions classified the majority of a nearshore 5-turbine, 34-km2 renewable energy zone off Block Island as high probability of use by black scoters, whereas an offshore 200-turbine, 667-km2 federal lease block zone was classified as low to medium-low probability of selection. Wind energy facilities, such as the Block Island site, constructed in relatively shallow (\ensuremath{<}20 m deep), nearshore habitats (\ensuremath{<}5 km) over hard-bottomed or coarse-sand substrate could displace some foraging black scoters wintering in this region, whereas the larger federal lease block zone located farther offshore is more likely to affect scoters dispersing among core-use areas and during migration between wintering and breeding grounds. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

Urbanized estuaries are critical wintering and stopover areas for many declining sea ducks in North America; however, conservation measures within estuaries are difficult to establish given lack of knowledge about habitat use by these species and the variety of competing human interests. We applied hierarchical modeling to evaluate resource selection of sea ducks (surf scoters, Melanitta perspicillata) wintering in San Francisco Bay, California, USA, a large and highly urbanized estuary. We also examined their distribution, home range, and movements with respect to key habitat features and regions within the estuary. Herring roe was the strongest predictor of bird locations; however, eelgrass, water depth and salinity were also highly-ranked, with sea ducks using deeper areas of higher salinity associated with herring roe and eelgrass presence during mid-winter. Sea ducks were also strongly associated with ferry routes, suggesting these areas may contain resources that are too important to avoid and emphasizing the need to better understand water traffic effects. Movements and home range size differed between males and females in early winter but became more similar in late winter. Birds traveled farther and used several sub-bays in early winter compared to mid-winter when herring roe availability peaked in the Central Bay. Our findings identified key environmental variables, highlighted core use areas, and documented critical periods for consideration when developing conservation plans for sea ducks in urbanized estuaries.},

Biological diversity of mollusc communities was found to have primary importance in determining spatial distribution of sea ducks under the most complicated winter climatic conditions, especially in the areas where sea duck populations were mainly feeding on molluscs. This finding strongly supports the earlier hypothetical assumption stating that under unfavourable winter climatic conditions large and dynamic sea duck populations are likely to over-exploit their benthic food stocks and the whole regional population of sea ducks is forced to gradually move towards the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea. The current study also proves that it is not the total biomass of certain mollusc species, but the average weight of mollusc specimens which is of a primary importance in determining spatial distribution of sea duck populations under extreme winter climatic conditions, especially in the areas where temporal sea duck concentrations are settled.},

During winter, molluscivorous sea ducks often form high density feeding flocks in association with patchily distributed prey, although few studies have documented the substrate and prey characteristics where sea ducks (tribe: Mergini) aggregate and thus what constitutes high-value sea duck foraging habitat. Sea duck surveys were conducted and benthic grab samples collected at sites with different benthic substrate characteristics to compare macroinvertebrate community assemblages in relation to densities of three species of sea ducks: (Surf (Melanitta peispicillata), Black (M. americana), and White-winged (M. fusca) scoters (hereafter “oscoters” when combined) during winter (2010–2011) in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, an urbanized estuary in the Northwest Atlantic. Overall, the highest densities of scoters (104 ± 17 per 0.5 km2) were found over sand substrates with homogeneous assemblages of infaunal prey. Significantly lower densities of scoters (21 ± 4 per 0.5 km2) were associated with mixed sand-gravel-mud substrates that supported epifaunal assemblages and patchily distributed infauna. Mean energy densities (kcal/g) were higher among infaunal (0.64–4.49) vs. epifaunal (0.17–0.53) prey. Overall biomass (g/m2) of polychaetes was higher in mixed substrates, and biomass of infaunal bivalves did not significantly differ among habitat type. However, infaunal prey may have been less accessible to scoters at sites with mixed substrates due to a barrier effect created by high-densities of epifauna with low energetic value. Thus, sand-substrate sites supporting infaunal benthic communities may provide high-quality feeding habitat for scoters wintering in the Northwest Atlantic. Understanding the influences of benthic habitat characteristics and macroinvertebrate prey assemblages on distribution of feeding scoters is particularly important for managing sea ducks in areas with increasing anthropogenic development in the coastal zone.},

For example, large-scale offshore wind farms are proposed for UK waters, and surveys are currently being conducted to quantify numbers and distribution ahead of construction. 2. Technological advances mean that strip transect surveys may now be conducted, using digital methods. We address survey design and data analysis issues for such digital surveys, contrasting them with visual aerial line transect surveys. 3. We also explore the relative performances of the methods for estimating the size of a large aggregation of common scoters in Carmarthen Bay, Wales. We found that abundance estimates from two digital methods were closely comparable, while estimates from visual aerial surveys were appreciably lower. 4. Synthesis and applications. Efficient survey methods to quantify abundance and distribution of seabirds are needed, to assess change arising from climate change, or developments such as the construction of large-scale offshore wind farms. The traditional survey methods are visual surveys conducted along transects from ships or aircraft. Digital video and stills surveys can be conducted from aircraft flying sufficiently high to avoid disturbance, while still being able to detect and identify seabirds. Given the rapid technological developments, we expect digital surveys largely to replace visual surveys for seabirds in offshore regions.},

This paper examines bias associated with pelagic aerial strip-transects, an easily designed and low cost survey method, to validate its use for monitoring and mapping seabird populations at sea at a very large scale. We used data collected on the entire seabird community between October 2001 and March 2002 in the Bay of Biscay (100 000 km2 on the French Atlantic coast, Northeast Atlantic) to determine whether aerial strip-transect seabird survey were subject to temporal (i.e. variations of detection probability during the survey) or distance (i.e. variations of detection probability across the strip) bias. To detect these biases, two seabird taxa were contrasted, the highly conspicuous northern gannet versus three cryptic species of auks pooled as one taxonomic group. We reported that the only temporal bias was attributable to sun glare. By contrast, distance bias did not occur in a strip of 150 m for both species, and the effect of distance up to 230 m was very weak. We conclude that visibility bias have a limited effect on pelagic aerial surveys for most seabird species. Particular attention should be paid to the constant record of sun glare, while altitude and speed can be fixed in a relatively wide range (140–180 m, 150–200 km/h) without affecting detection probability. Since distance bias did not occur across a 150 m strip, there is no need to add complexity to survey protocol by using line-transect method. This method takes distance effects into account but requires distance estimates between the bird and the transect line for every sightings. These estimates are usually easily collected in the case of marine mammals but become problematic in the case of flying animals such seabirds, sometimes encountered in very high density and aggregated into groups of several hundred individuals.},

  shorttitle = {Species distribution models and ecological theory},
  abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling.

A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification.

Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables.

Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory.

Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used.

Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology.},

The increasing demand for locations with suitable wind resource places pressure on bird species and sites of conservation importance. Our understanding of the effects of wind-energy generation on birds is growing, but ambitious targets for wind-energy production mean that we need to apply best available information in smarter ways now, refining our approaches as evidence accrues. This applies especially to the offshore “windrush,” which is taking place in Europe, notably the United Kingdom, which currently leads the world in installed capacity offshore.

  abstract = {* Long-term demographic studies show that seabird populations may suffer from competition with fisheries. Understanding this process is critical for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF). Existing studies rely mostly on indirect clues: overlaps between seabird foraging and fishing areas, comparing fish catches by seabirds and vessels.

* The study is based on a GPS tracking experiment performed in 2007 on one of the main guano-producing seabird species, the Peruvian booby, breeding on an island near the major port for anchovy landings in Peru. The fishery, which is entirely monitored by a Vessel Monitoring System, opened the day we began the tracking experiment, providing a unique opportunity to examine the day-to-day effects of an intense fishing activity on seabird foraging behaviour.

* We observed a significant increase in the range of the daily trips and distances of the dives by birds from the colony. This increase was significantly related to the concomitant fishing activity. Seabirds progressively became more segregated in space from the vessels. Their increased foraging effort was significantly related to the growing quantity of anchovy removals by the fishery. In addition, daily removals by the fishery were at least 100 times greater than the daily anchovy requirement of the seabird colonies. We conclude that seabirds needed to forage farther to cope with the regional prey depletion created by the intensive fishing behaviour of this open access fishery.

* Synthesis and applications. We show that the foraging efficiency of breeding seabirds may be significantly affected by not only the global quantity, but also the temporal and spatial patterns of fishery removals. Together with an ecosystem-based definition of the fishery quota, an EAF should limit the risk of local depletion around breeding colonies using, for instance, adaptive marine protected areas.},

Within a team, each observer reports their uncolluded observations into a separate track of a 2-track tape recorder, so that after the survey, each group can be characterized as being seen by only 1 (specified) or both members of the team.

A substantial proportion, perhaps 30\%, of the North American breeding population of Long-tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis) winter in the vicinity of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. These birds spend the night on Nantucket Sound and commute during daylight hours to the Nantucket Shoals, which extend about 65 km offshore from the southeastern corner of Nantucket. Strip transects done from a single-engine plane in 1997 and 1998 indicated that Long-tailed Ducks foraged over the shallower (≤ 20 m depth) portions of the Nantucket Shoals, up to 70 km offshore. Diet analyses of ten birds collected in February 1999 and five in December 2006 showed that they fed principally (106.6 +/- 42.0 individuals per crop) on Gammarus annulatus, a pelagic amphipod that often forms large aggregations, and is consumed by several species of fish and marine mammals. Our findings emphasize the importance of conservation of the Nantucket Shoals and the prevention of oil spills or other potentially harmful accidents.},

  abstract = {In the Arctic, there is great concern for several eider populations, including the northern common eider (Somateria mollissima borealis) breeding in Canada and Greenland. In 1998-2001, extensive ground surveys were conducted on 937 potential nesting islands in West Greenland, covering most of the districts of Ilulissat, Uummannaq, and Upernavik (69°15' N to 74°05' N). On 216 islands within 106 eider colonies, 4097 ± 468 active nests were identified. In 15 colonies where comparable and well-documented surveys were conducted approximately 40 years ago, the study shows a population decline of 81\% (from 3361 to 624 nests). A rough comparison shows that of 51 eider colonies surveyed in 1920, 1960, or 1965, 71\% either were gone or had declined in breeding numbers when resurveyed in 1998-2001. At the colony level, the 1998-2001 surveys revealed large year-to-year variations in nesting numbers. The reason for the overall decline is not clear. However, there is circumstantial evidence that harvest of common eiders in West Greenland is a key factor. The results urgently call for more cautious management of the northern common eider population. /// On se préoccupe beaucoup dans l'Arctique de plusieurs populations d'eiders, y compris l'eider à duvet (Somateria mollissima borealis) qui se reproduit au Canada et au Groenland. De 1998 à 2001, on a procédé à de vastes relevés au sol sur 937 îles susceptibles d'abriter des nids dans l'ouest du Groenland, une zone qui recouvrait la plupart des districts d'Ilulissat, d'Uummannaq et d'Upernavik (69° 15' de latit. N. à 74° 05' de latit. N.) Sur 216 îles situées à l'intérieur de 106 colonies d'eiders, on a identifié 4097 ± 468 nids actifs. Dans 15 colonies où des relevés comparables et bien documentés ont été effectués il y a 40 ans, l'étude révèle une baisse de la population de 81 \% (soit de 3361 à 624 nids). Une première comparaison montre que des 51 colonies d'eiders étudiées en 1920, 1960 ou 1965, 71 \% avaient soit disparu, soit enregistré une baisse du nombre de paires lors des nouveaux relevés effectués entre 1998 et 2001. Au niveau de la colonie, ces derniers relevés montraient d'importantes variations interannuelles dans le nombre de nids. La raison de la baisse globale n'est pas très claire, mais certains indices prouvent que le prélèvement de l'eider à duvet dans l'ouest du Groenland est un facteur clé. Les résultats appellent à une plus grande prudence dans la gestion de la population de l'eider à duvet, et ce, au plus vite.},

Oceanic regime shifts have been associated with rapid changes in ecosystem structure of the North Pacific and Bering Sea. However, relatively little is known about potential effects of these changes in oceanic conditions on marine bird populations at broad scales. I examined changes in North American breeding populations of sea ducks from 1957 to 2011 in relation to potential oceanic regime shifts in the North Pacific in 1977, 1989, and 1998. There was strong support for population-level effects of regime shifts in 1977 and 1989, but little support for an effect of the 1998 shift. The continental-level effects of these regime shifts differed across species groups and time. Based on patterns of sea duck population dynamics associated with regime shifts, it is unclear if the mechanism of change relates to survival or reproduction. Results of this analysis support the hypothesis that population size and trends of North American sea ducks are strongly influenced by oceanic conditions. The perceived population declines appear to have halted \ensuremath{>}20 years ago, and populations have been relatively stable or increasing since that time. Given these results, we should reasonably expect dramatic changes in sea duck population status and trends with future oceanic regime shifts.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind farms are proposed around the coast of the UK and elsewhere in Europe. These sites tend to be located in shallow coastal waters that often coincide with areas used by over-wintering Common Scoter Melanitta nigra. A large-scale study was undertaken to ascertain the relationship of the spatial distribution of Common Scoter in Liverpool Bay with prey abundance and environmental and anthropogenic variables that may affect foraging efficiency. The highest numbers of Common Scoter coincided with sites that had a high abundance and biomass of bivalve prey species. There was strong evidence that the maximum observed biomass of bivalves occurred at a mean depth of c. 14 m off the Lancashire coast and at c. 8 m off the north Wales coast. This coincided well with the distribution of Common Scoter at Shell Flat, but less well with the distribution of birds off North Wales. Common Scoters were observed in lowest numbers or were absent from areas in which anthropogenic disturbance (shipping activity) was relatively intense, even when these areas held a high prey biomass. Commercial fishing activities did not appear to contribute to this disturbance.},

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological processes that underpin species distribution patterns is a fundamental goal in spatial ecology. However, developing predictive models of habitat use is challenging for species that forage in marine environments, as both predators and prey are often highly mobile and difficult to monitor. Consequently, few studies have developed resource selection functions for marine predators based directly on the abundance and distribution of their prey. We analyse contemporaneous data on the diving locations of two seabird species, the shallow-diving Peruvian Booby (Sula variegata) and deeper-diving Guanay Cormorant (Phalacrocorax bougainvilliorum), and the abundance and depth distribution of their main prey, Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens). Based on this unique dataset, we develop resource selection functions to test the hypothesis that the probability of seabird diving behaviour at a given location is a function of the relative abundance of prey in the upper water column. For both species, we show that the probability of diving behaviour is mostly explained by the distribution of prey at shallow depths. While the probability of diving behaviour increases sharply with prey abundance at relatively low levels of abundance, support for including abundance in addition to the depth distribution of prey is weak, suggesting that prey abundance was not a major factor determining the location of diving behaviour during the study period. The study thus highlights the importance of the depth distribution of prey for two species of seabird with different diving capabilities. The results complement previous research that points towards the importance of oceanographic processes that enhance the accessibility of prey to seabirds. The implications are that locations where prey is predictably found at accessible depths may be more important for surface foragers, such as seabirds, than locations where prey is predictably abundant. Analysis of the relative importance of abundance and accessibility is essential for the design and evaluation of effective management responses to reduced prey availability for seabirds and other top predators in marine systems.

* 2.The interaction between off-bottom, suspended oyster farming and wintering sea ducks in coastal British Columbia was studied. Specifically, the habitat use of surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and Barrow's goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), the most abundant sea duck species in the study area, was evaluated in relation to natural environmental attributes and shellfish aquaculture.
* 3.The extent of shellfish farming was the best-supported habitat variable explaining variation in surf scoter densities, and the only habitat attribute from the considered set that was a strong predictor of Barrow's goldeneye densities. In both cases, the findings indicated strong positive relationships between densities of sea ducks and shellfish aquaculture operations. These relationships are presumably the result of large numbers of wild mussels (Mytilus trossulus) that settle and grow on aquaculture structures and are preferred prey of these sea ducks.
* 4.Previous work has shown that aquaculture structures provide good conditions for recruiting and growing mussels, including refuge from invertebrate predators, which in turn provides higher densities of higher quality prey for sea ducks than available in intertidal areas. This offers a rare example in which introduction of an industry leads to positive effects on wildlife populations, which is particularly important given persistent declines in numbers of many sea ducks.

Changes in the available food stocks are assumed to be an important cause of this trend. In order to extend the knowledge of the importance of particular food sources to wintering Eiders, data on distribution of Eiders obtained from aerial counts were spatially related to routinely collected monitoring data of shellfish. Based on previous diet studies, we hypothesized that the distribution of Eiders in the Dutch Wadden Sea is related to the presence of Mytilus edulis stocks and that M. edulis from the sublittoral areas, especially the ones from mussel culture plots will have the strongest effect on Eider distribution. Boosted regression tree models were applied to quantify the relative importance of different potential prey items on the distribution of wintering Eiders. Indeed, Eiders were found to prefer sites with high densities of medium- and large-sized M. edulis, especially from mussel culture plots. Other bivalve species seemed to serve as alternative prey, since sites with a relatively high abundance of these species increased in importance, when less M. edulis was available on culture plots. The contribution of cultured M. edulis to the diet of Eiders decreased during the course of the winter seasons, indicating that harvesting of M. edulis from the culture plots might reduce this high-quality food source at the end of the winter, forcing the Eiders to switch to less profitable prey.},

  abstract = {Summary.  A general class of statistical models for a univariate response variable is presented which we call the generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS). The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

We describe regression models for breeding bird communities that facilitate both model choice and variable selection, by a boosting algorithm that works within a class of geoadditive regression models comprising spatial effects, nonparametric effects of continuous covariates, interaction surfaces, and varying coefficients. The major modeling components are penalized splines and their bivariate tensor product extensions. All smooth model terms are represented as the sum of a parametric component and a smooth component with one degree of freedom to obtain a fair comparison between the model terms. A generic representation of the geoadditive model allows us to devise a general boosting algorithm that automatically performs model choice and variable selection.},

These results require no (e.g. exchangeability) assumptions on the underlying model or on the quality of the original selection procedure. Under reasonable shape restrictions, the bounds can be further tightened, yielding improved error control, and therefore increasing the applicability of the methodology.},

Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated.

  abstract = {1. Issues with ecological data (e.g. non-normality of errors, nonlinear relationships and autocorrelation of variables) and modelling (e.g. overfitting, variable selection and prediction) complicate regression analyses in ecology. Flexible models, such as generalized additive models (GAMs), can address data issues, and machine learning techniques (e.g. gradient boosting) can help resolve modelling issues. Gradient boosted GAMs do both. Here, we illustrate the advantages of this technique using data on benthic macroinvertebrates and fish from 1573 small streams in Maryland, USA. 2. We assembled a predictor matrix of 15 watershed attributes (e.g. ecoregion and land use), 15 stream attributes (e.g. width and habitat quality) and location (latitude and longitude). We built boosted and conventionally estimated GAMs for macroinvertebrate richness and for the relative abundances of macroinvertebrates in the Orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (\%EPT); individuals that cling to substrate (\%Clingers); and individuals in the collector/gatherer functional feeding group (\%Collectors). For fish, models were constructed for taxonomic richness, benthic species richness, biomass and the relative abundance of tolerant individuals (\%Tolerant Fish). 3. For several of the responses, boosted GAMs had lower pseudo R2s than conventional GAMs for in-sample data but larger pseudo R2s for out-of-bootstrap data, suggesting boosted GAMs do not overfit the data and have higher prediction accuracy than conventional GAMs. The models explained most variation in fish richness (pseudo R2 = 0·97), least variation in \%Clingers (pseudo R2 = 0·28) and intermediate amounts of variation in the other responses (pseudo R2s between 0·41 and 0·60). Many relationships of macroinvertebrate responses to anthropogenic measures and natural watershed attributes were nonlinear. Fish responses were related to system size and local habitat quality. 4. For impervious surface, models predicted below model-average macroinvertebrate richness at levels above c. 3·0\%, lower \%EPT above c. 1·5\%, and lower \%Clingers for levels above c. 2·0\%. Impervious surface did not affect \%Collectors or any fish response. Prediction functions for \%EPT and fish richness increased linearly with log10 (watershed area), \%Tolerant Fish decreased with log10 (watershed area), and benthic fish richness and biomass both increased nonlinearly with log10 (watershed area). 5. Gradient boosting optimizes the predictive accuracy of GAMs while preserving the structure of conventional GAMs, so that predictor–response relationships are more interpretable than with other machine learning methods. Boosting also avoids overfitting the data (by shrinking effect estimates towards zero and by performing variable selection), thus avoiding spurious predictor effects and interpretations. Thus, in many ecological settings, it may be reasonable to use boosting instead of conventional GAMs.},

  abstract = {Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.},

Such knowledge is frequently gathered from studies relating abundance data to a set of influential variables in a regression setup. In particular, generalised linear models are used to analyse binary presence/absence data or counts of a certain species at locations within an observation area. However, one of the key assumptions of generalised linear models, the independence of observations is often violated in practice since the points at which the observations are collected are spatially aligned. In this paper, we describe a general framework for semiparametric spatial generalised linear models that allows for the routine analysis of non-normal spatially aligned regression data. The approach is utilised for the analysis of a data set of synthetic bird species in beech forests, revealing that ignorance of spatial dependence actually may lead to false conclusions in a number of situations.},

  abstract = {The potential advantage of extreme value theory in modeling ecological disturbances is the central theme of this paper. The statistics of extremes have played only a very limited role in ecological modeling, despite the disproportionate influence of unusual disturbances on ecosystems. An overview of this theory is provided, with emphasis on recent developments that both make more efficient use of the available data on extremes and enable applications that are more ecologically realistic. Consistent with the emphasis on scale in ecology, scaling properties of extremes are emphasized. It is argued that the existence of distributions whose extreme upper tail is “heavy” (i.e., decreases at a relatively slow rate) implies that ecological disturbances are sometimes regarded as more “surprising” than they ought to be. The application focuses on modeling disturbances in paleoecology. Two examples are considered: the first, a sediment yield time series for Nicolay Lake in the high Arctic, reflects only the influence of hydrologic disturbances; the second, a sediment rate time series in the Chesapeake Bay, includes both climatic and anthropogenic influences. Strong evidence supports a heavy-tailed distribution for the Nicolay Lake sediment yield, but not necessarily for the Chesapeake Bay sediment rates. For each example, it is demonstrated how the statistics of extremes can readily incorporate information about covariates, such as large-scale atmospheric–oceanic circulation patterns or land use.},

  abstract = {Most species abundance data show that a small number of species contribute the vast majority of individuals to a community. Thus, most taxa in a community are uncommon or rare. Yet such species will frequently be of ecological, conservation, or management interest. Data for uncommon or rare species will be presence/absence data or counts of abundance that contain a greater number of zero observations than would be predicted using standard, unimodal statistical distributions. Such data are generally referred to as zero-inflated data and require specialized methods for statistical analysis. Statistical approaches to modeling zero-inflated data include nonstandard mixture models; two-part, conditional models; and birth process models. In this paper, we briefly summarize two of these methods and illustrate the two-part, conditional approach to the problem of modeling count data with extra zeros. An advantage of this approach includes separate fits and separate interpretations of both components of count data; that is to say, the presence/absence component and the abundance component (given presence) can be analyzed separately. This can be valuable not only for simplicity, but also such a two-step method may assist ecological understanding in cases where the basis for species presence might be separated from the underlying reasons affecting the population size of that species at those sites where it is present. We present two case studies of the application of the two-part conditional model for modeling count data with extra zeros. One deals with modeling relationships between counts of the rare and endangered arboreal marsupial, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) and habitat variables in the wet eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia. The other is an analysis of data obtained from a monitoring study of seabird nesting from the Coral Sea off northeastern Australia. Finally, we briefly discuss some inferential and practical issues in developing designs and models for presence/absence data (which is the first component in the two-part conditional approach) when observed occurrences are low (e.g., \ensuremath{<}5\%).},

* 5We conclude that individual strategies exist that interact with environmental conditions to form multiple movement patterns.
* 6While a minor proportion of winter movements may be forced by environmental conditions, we propose that many winter movements may be of an exploratory nature where individuals aim to acquire information about alternative wintering sites that may enhance their survival probability at some point in time when environmental fluctuation renders their preferred wintering site unsuitable.},

  abstract = {Aim  Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used to address a wide range of theoretical and applied questions in the terrestrial realm, but marine-based applications remain relatively scarce. In this review, we consider how conceptual and practical issues associated with terrestrial SDMs apply to a range of marine organisms and highlight the challenges relevant to improving marine SDMs. Location  We include studies from both marine and terrestrial systems that encompass many geographic locations around the globe. Methods  We first performed a literature search and analysis of marine and terrestrial SDMs in ISI Web of Science to assess trends and applications. Using knowledge from terrestrial applications, we critically evaluate the application of SDMs in marine systems in the context of ecological factors (dispersal, species interactions, aggregation and ontogenetic shifts) and practical considerations (data quality, alternative modelling approaches and model validation) that facilitate or create difficulties for model application. Results  The relative importance of ecological factors to be considered when applying SDMs varies among terrestrial and marine organisms. Correctly incorporating dispersal is frequently considered an important issue for terrestrial models, but because there is greater potential for dispersal in the ocean, it is often less of a concern in marine SDMs. By contrast, ontogenetic shifts and feeding have received little attention in terrestrial SDM applications, but these factors are important to many marine SDMs. Opportunities also exist for applying more advanced SDM approaches in the marine realm, including mechanistic ecophysiological models, where water balance and heat transfer equations are simpler for some marine organisms relative to their terrestrial counterparts. Main conclusions  SDMs have generally been under-utilized in the marine realm relative to terrestrial applications. Correlative SDM methods should be tested on a range of marine organisms, and we suggest further development of methods that address ontogenetic shifts and feeding interactions. We anticipate developments in, and cross-fertilization between, coupled correlative and process-based SDMs, mechanistic eco-physiological SDMs, and spatial population dynamic models for climate change and species invasion applications in particular. Comparisons of the outputs of different model types will provide insight that is useful for improved spatial management of marine species.},

  abstract = {* 1Wind energy is a fast-growing renewable energy source and many offshore wind parks will be erected in shallow waters (\ensuremath{<} 40 m deep) where various coastal bird species are found. The two main issues regarding offshore wind farms and birds are disturbance and collision risk. We studied the effect of wind turbines on the flight behaviour of wintering common eiders Somateria mollissima in order to identify the properties that cause disturbance and the factors that may increase their risk of collision.
* 2The study was conducted at Tunø Knob offshore wind park in the Kattegat, Denmark. We attracted birds though the use of decoys located at increasing distances from the wind park. To discriminate between the potential disturbance effect of the standing towers from that of the revolving rotor blades, wind turbines were switched on or off alternately during 10 experimental trials.
* 3Common eiders reacted strongly to the presence of wind turbines. The number of flying birds was significantly related to flight corridor location and position of the decoy group. That behavioural reaction was interpreted to be a consequence of their high speed and low-manoeuvrability flight occurring within the vertical height range of the wind turbines. The number of landing birds also reacted to the position of the decoy group in relation to proximity to the turbines, with the greatest effects observed within the wind park. Such avoidance behaviour might decrease use of otherwise suitable habitat.
* 4The movement and noise of rotors affected neither the number of common eiders flying within corridors nor the number of birds reacting to decoys. This suggests that the avoidance behaviour observed was caused by the presence of the structures themselves and that eiders use vision when avoiding human-made structures.
* 5Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated that common eiders avoid flying close to or into the Tunø Knob wind park. This behaviour may result in a reduction in habitat availability within and around wind parks, and raises concerns about the possible impact of the extensive development of large-scale wind parks in shallow offshore waters, which are the main feeding areas for sea ducks and other marine birds. Our results indicate that the disturbance effect of revolving rotor blades is negligible during daylight hours but highlights the need for studies to be carried out during hours of darkness and conditions of poor visibility (e.g. fog and snow). Until more insight is gained, we recommend caution when planning wind parks in areas of high sea duck densities.},

  abstract = {We describe an approach to dynamically couple a fish bioenergetics-based population dynamics model to the NEMURO lower trophic level nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton model. The coupled models, denoted NEMURO.FISH and configured for Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasii) on the west coast of Vancouver Island, are capable of simulating the daily dynamics of the lower trophic levels and the daily average weight and numbers of individual herring in each of 10 age classes over multiple years. New recruits to the herring population are added each June based on either constant recruitment or dynamic recruitment generated from an environmental Ricker spawner–recruitment relationship. The dynamics of the three zooplankton groups in the NEMURO model determine the consumption rate of the herring; herring consumption affects the zooplankton, and egestion and excretion contribute to the nitrogen dynamics. NEMURO was previously calibrated to field data for the West Coast Vancouver Island. Thirty-year simulations of herring growth and population dynamics were performed that used repeated environmental conditions for the lower trophic levels of NEMURO and historical environmental variables for the herring spawner–recruit relationship. Herring dynamics were calibrated to the west coast of Vancouver Island such that the coupled models reasonably duplicated observed herring weights-at-age and total herring biomass. Additional 30-year simulations under constant recruitment with herring coupled and uncoupled from NEMURO clearly showed the effects of the feedback mechanism between the two models and also showed that herring have small to moderate effects on their prey. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis showed the importance of feeding- and respiration-related parameters to predicted individual and population herring growth. The utility of the NEMURO.FISH framework for improving our understanding of climate change effects on marine ecosystem dynamics is discussed.},

  abstract = {Predators and prey assort themselves relative to each other, the availability of resources and refuges, and the temporal and spatial scale of their interaction. Predictive models of predator distributions often rely on these relationships by incorporating data on environmental variability and prey availability to determine predator habitat selection patterns. This approach to predictive modeling holds true in marine systems where observations of predators are logistically difficult, emphasizing the need for accurate models. In this paper, we ask whether including prey distribution data in fine-scale predictive models of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) habitat selection in Florida Bay, Florida, USA, improves predictive capacity. Environmental characteristics are often used as predictor variables in habitat models of top marine predators with the assumption that they act as proxies of prey distribution. We examine the validity of this assumption by comparing the response of dolphin distribution and fish catch rates to the same environmental variables. Next, the predictive capacities of four models, with and without prey distribution data, are tested to determine whether dolphin habitat selection can be predicted without recourse to describing the distribution of their prey. The final analysis determines the accuracy of predictive maps of dolphin distribution produced by modeling areas of high fish catch based on significant environmental characteristics. We use spatial analysis and independent data sets to train and test the models. Our results indicate that, due to high habitat heterogeneity and the spatial variability of prey patches, fine-scale models of dolphin habitat selection in coastal habitats will be more successful if environmental variables are used as predictor variables of predator distributions rather than relying on prey data as explanatory variables. However, predictive modeling of prey distribution as the response variable based on environmental variability did produce high predictive performance of dolphin habitat selection, particularly foraging habitat.},

Data on oceanographic conditions, the distribution of sea birds and the distribution of fish in the upper water column were collected during three research surveys off Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada). At the large spatial scale, we found that both murres and shearwaters were more abundant inshore than offshore of the shelf break and that their fish prey were likewise more abundant in the inshore habitat. At the smaller scale, we investigated the relative importance of fronts and fish density. In contrast to what we expected based on our finding at the large spatial scale, there was a significant negative relationship between fish and both murre and shearwater density. We found that fronts, independent of fish density, did not have an effect on small-scale murre density and had only a weak effect on small-scale shearwater density. We suggest that the negative relationship between fish and sea bird density at the scale of kilometres may have been due to fish diving to escape foraging sea birds and thus avoiding capture in the near-surface trawl used in this study. If this avoidance behaviour is common in pelagic fish, then sea birds may affect fish populations by driving fish away from plankton-rich surface waters and thus negatively affecting the feeding and growth rates of their fish prey.},

  abstract = {Aim  We demonstrate how to integrate two widely used tools for modelling the spread of invasive plants, and compare the performance of the combined model with that of its individual components using the recent range dynamics of the invasive annual weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. Location  Austria. Methods  Species distribution models, which deliver habitat-based information on potential distributions, and interacting particle systems, which simulate spatio-temporal range dynamics as dependent on neighbourhood configurations, were combined into a common framework. We then used the combined model to simulate the invasion of A. artemisiifolia in Austria between 1990 and 2005. For comparison, simulations were also performed with models that accounted only for habitat suitability or neighbourhood configurations. The fit of the three models to the data was assessed by likelihood ratio tests, and simulated invasion patterns were evaluated against observed ones in terms of predictive discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC) and spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I). Results  The combined model fitted the data significantly better than the single-component alternatives. Simulations relying solely on parameterized spread kernels performed worst in terms of both AUC and spatial pattern formation. Simulations based only on habitat information correctly predicted infestation of susceptible areas but reproduced the autocorrelated patterns of A. artemisiifolia expansion less adequately than did the integrated model. Main conclusions  Our integrated modelling approach offers a flexible tool for forecasts of spatio-temporal invasion patterns from landscape to regional scales. As a further advantage, scenarios of environmental change can be incorporated consistently by appropriately updating habitat suitability layers. Given the susceptibility of many alien plants, including A. artemisiifolia, to both land use and climate changes, taking such scenarios into account will increasingly become relevant for the design of proactive management strategies.},

Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species’ ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

  abstract = {Spatial coherence between predators and prey has rarely been observed in pelagic marine ecosystems. We used measures of the environment, prey abundance, prey quality, and prey distribution to explain the observed distributions of three co-occurring predator species breeding on islands in the southeastern Bering Sea: black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). Predictions of statistical models were tested using movement patterns obtained from satellite-tracked individual animals. With the most commonly used measures to quantify prey distributions - areal biomass, density, and numerical abundance - we were unable to find a spatial relationship between predators and their prey. We instead found that habitat use by all three predators was predicted most strongly by prey patch characteristics such as depth and local density within spatial aggregations. Additional prey patch characteristics and physical habitat also contributed significantly to characterizing predator patterns. Our results indicate that the small-scale prey patch characteristics are critical to how predators perceive the quality of their food supply and the mechanisms they use to exploit it, regardless of time of day, sampling year, or source colony. The three focal predator species had different constraints and employed different foraging strategies – a shallow diver that makes trips of moderate distance (kittiwakes), a deep diver that makes trip of short distances (murres), and a deep diver that makes extensive trips (fur seals). However, all three were similarly linked by patchiness of prey rather than by the distribution of overall biomass. This supports the hypothesis that patchiness may be critical for understanding predator-prey relationships in pelagic marine systems more generally.},

  abstract = {* 1Remote-sensing measurements of marine primary productivity are widely used to predict the distribution and movements of marine top predators, despite the fact that predators do not feed directly on phytoplankton but several trophic levels higher up the food chain.
* 2To test for potential links between primary productivity and top-predator feeding hotspots, we assessed spatial match–mismatch across four trophic levels of the Benguela upwelling zone (south-east Atlantic). The food chain studied consisted of phytoplankton, zooplankton (copepods), pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines) and two top predators (Cape gannets Morus capensis and human fisheries).
* 3Remote-sensing data of sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll\_a concentration were used as indices of phytoplankton abundance throughout the study area. Copepod biomass and pelagic fish density were determined during at-sea surveys in the South African section of the Benguela using net tows and hydro-acoustics, respectively. Seabird (Cape gannet) home ranges and foraging zones were assessed from two Namibian breeding colonies (Mercury and Ichaboe) and two South African colonies (Lambert's Bay and Malgas) using global positioning system (GPS) tracking. Industrial fishing for anchovies and sardines was investigated using South African landing statistics and logbooks.
* 4Our spatial analyses revealed a strong match of seabird at-sea habitat and zones of high primary productivity throughout the southern Benguela. Conversely, there was a marked spatial mismatch between copepods and pelagic fish, as well as between pelagic fish, seabirds and human fisheries: copepods were present in the southern Benguela but pelagic fish usually feeding upon them were located further east (Indian Ocean), outside of the Benguela sensu stricto. Consequently, the majority of these pelagic fish were out of reach for seabirds and fisheries confined to the southern Benguela.
* 5Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the impact of an ecosystem shift across one of the world's most productive marine ecosystems and highlights the limitations of using remote-sensed patterns of primary productivity to interpret the foraging behaviour of marine top predators. These findings underline the importance of a better knowledge of food web spatial dynamics to support ecosystem-based fisheries management and the conservation of marine top predators.},

  abstract = {1. All reserve designs must be guided by an understanding of natural history and habitat variability. 2. Differences in scale and predictability set aside highly dynamic pelagic systems from terrestrial and nearshore ecosystems, where wildlife reserves were first implemented. Yet, as in static systems, many pelagic species use predictable habitats to breed and forage. Marine protected areas (MPAs) could be designed to protect these foraging and breeding aggregations. 3. Understanding the physical mechanisms that influence the formation and persistence of these aggregations is essential in order to define and implement pelagic protected areas. We classify pelagic habitats according to their dynamics and predictability into three categories: static, persistent and ephemeral features. 4. While traditional designs are effective in static habitats, many important pelagic habitats are neither fixed nor predictable. Thus, pelagic protected areas will require dynamic boundaries and extensive buffers. 5. In addition, the protection of far-ranging pelagic vertebrates will require dynamic MPAs defined by the extent and location of large-scale oceanographic features. 6. Recent technological advances and our ability to implement large-scale conservation actions will facilitate the implementation of pelagic protected areas. 7. The establishment of pelagic MPAs should include enforcement, research and monitoring programmes to evaluate design effectiveness. 8. Ultimately, society will need a holistic management scheme for entire ocean basins. Such overarching management will rely on many innovative tools, including the judicious use of pelagic MPAs.

However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the relative importance of physical, chemical and biological factors as potential explanatory variables for meso-scale spatio-temporal patterns of intertidal community structure in these systems. Here, we investigate macroinfaunal community structure of a micro-tidal sandy beach that is located on an oligotrophic subtropical coast and is influenced by seasonal estuarine input. We repeatedly sampled biological and environmental variables at a series of beach transects arranged at increasing distances from the estuary mouth. Sampling took place over a period of five months, corresponding with the transition between the dry and wet season. This allowed assessment of biological-physical relationships across chemical and nutritional gradients associated with a range of estuarine inputs. Physical, chemical, and biological response variables, as well as measures of community structure, showed significant spatio-temporal patterns. In general, bivariate relationships between biological and environmental variables were rare and weak. However, multivariate correlation approaches identified a variety of environmental variables (i.e., sampling session, the C∶N ratio of particulate organic matter, dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations, various size fractions of photopigment concentrations, salinity and, to a lesser extent, beach width and sediment kurtosis) that either alone or combined provided significant explanatory power for spatio-temporal patterns of macroinfaunal community structure. Overall, these results showed that the macrobenthic community on Mtunzini Beach was not structured primarily by physical factors, but instead by a complex and dynamic blend of nutritional, chemical and physical drivers. This emphasises the need to recognise ocean-exposed sandy beaches as functional ecosystems in their own right.},

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) provide an important tool for conservation of marine ecosystems. To be most effective, these areas should be strategically located in a manner that supports ecosystem function. To inform marine spatial planning and support strategic establishment of MPAs within the California Current System, we identified areas predicted to support multispecies aggregations of seabirds (“hotspots”). We developed habitat-association models for 16 species using information from at-sea observations collected over an 11-year period (1997–2008), bathymetric data, and remotely sensed oceanographic data for an area from north of Vancouver Island, Canada, to the USA/Mexico border and seaward 600 km from the coast. This approach enabled us to predict distribution and abundance of seabirds even in areas of few or no surveys. We developed single-species predictive models using a machine-learning algorithm: bagged decision trees. Single-species predictions were then combined to identify potential hotspots of seabird aggregation, using three criteria: (1) overall abundance among species, (2) importance of specific areas (“core areas”) to individual species, and (3) predicted persistence of hotspots across years. Model predictions were applied to the entire California Current for four seasons (represented by February, May, July, and October) in each of 11 years. Overall, bathymetric variables were often important predictive variables, whereas oceanographic variables derived from remotely sensed data were generally less important. Predicted hotspots often aligned with currently protected areas (e.g., National Marine Sanctuaries), but we also identified potential hotspots in Northern California/Southern Oregon (from Cape Mendocino to Heceta Bank), Southern California (adjacent to the Channel Islands), and adjacent to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, that are not currently included in protected areas. Prioritization and identification of multispecies hotspots will depend on which group of species is of highest management priority. Modeling hotspots at a broad spatial scale can contribute to MPA site selection, particularly if complemented by fine-scale information for focal areas.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: A goal of seabird ecology is to relate the physiology, population dynamics, distribution and behaviour of seabirds with their biotic and abiotic environments. One of the most challenging aspects is to understand how seabirds interact with their environment when direct observations are not always possible or practical. In the present paper, we reviewed 218 published studies that examined associations between seabird distribution, behaviour and their environment, in order to assess current trends, weaknesses and the future directions of research. Based on the number of publications, it is evident that the field is growing rapidly and that methods for evaluating seabird distribution are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and are changing from Eulerian (grid-like) to Lagrangian (particle-like) data types. This has been accompanied by a reduction in the spatial and temporal scale of observation, where, in most cases, no behavioural information is inferred from Lagrangian data; instead they are often used as if they were Eulerian data. In parallel, environmental remote sensing is becoming more common; however, we did not record significant changes in the statistical approaches used to describe seabird distributions and used to link them with oceanographic variables. In particular, despite the spatially explicit nature of the data, spatial statistics have rarely been used. The vast majority of studies used environmental variables that described water masses (descriptive approach), whereas a few studies determined oceanographic features that enhance prey availability to seabirds (process-based approach). Future studies could enhance their ecological interpretation of seabird–environment interactions by making greater use of ad hoc statistical approaches that facilitate appropriate pattern detection (e.g. area-restricted searching pattern for birds, mesoscale patterns for environment). Furthermore, appropriate hypothesis testing and modelling that accounts for the spatially explicit, multiscale and multivariate nature of the interaction between seabirds and their habitats is recommended. Although quantitative methods currently exist (but are rarely used), further application could greatly improve our understanding of the processes linking seabird distribution to their environment.},

Covariates (21 total), with importance assessed using logistic and generalized linear modeling and an information theoretic approach, included physical features such as sea surface temperature, dynamic height (apparent water-column pressure), and pycnocline depth; biological factors such as chlorophyll maximum; and food-web factors such as the density of 3 size classes of zooplankton, the density of potential piscine competitors, i.e. Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., and abundance of fish prey such as zooplankton, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and the juveniles of salmon and demersal fishes. The most important factors explaining seabird occurrence changed from mesoscale physical features during a food-rich year (2002; exhibited over 15 to 30 km) to smaller-scale occurrence of actual prey patches during a food-poor year (2000; \ensuremath{<}1 km). Spatial overlap in occurrence of murres and shearwaters with adult salmon was interpreted as co-occurrence and, perhaps, competition for prey species; a negative spatial overlap between shearwaters and abundance of forage fish was interpreted as evidence for prey depletion (or predator-induced alteration of availability) by the birds and other co-occurring predators (salmon). Overall, results and other information indicated the value of adding spatially explicit data on predator and prey species abundance and predator–prey behavior to improve food-web modeling.},

Seabirds were counted from ships in a study area of 27.8 × 32.8 km on 407 d from 1990 to 2007. Two hydrographic and 5 meteorological parameters were taken from archived data. The relationships between bird abundance and abiotic parameters were investigated by generalised additive models for 3 distinct seasons. The species in the study area exhibited different seasonal patterns. While some species were present year-round, others occurred only at certain periods. Despite these substantial changes in abundances, the nature of the interactions between bird abundances and abiotic parameters did not vary much between seasons. All 5 meteorological and 2 hydrographic parameters significantly influenced the abundance of seabird species, though to a different degree. The single factors that most often had a significant influence in the single models were wind field, sea surface temperature anomaly, sea surface salinity anomaly and air pressure change. The quantitative composition of the seabird community differed significantly between onshore wind and offshore wind conditions. It is assumed that hydrographic parameters are relevant for the birds by determining their foraging habitats and that atmospheric parameters influence flight conditions during foraging and migration.},

  abstract = {This paper is part of a comprehensive review of the oceanography of the eastern tropical Pacific, the oceanic region centered on the eastern Pacific warm pool, but also including the equatorial cold tongue and equatorial current system, and summarizes what is known about oceanographic influences on seabirds and cetaceans there. The eastern tropical Pacific supports on the order of 50 species of seabirds and 30 species of cetaceans as regular residents; these include four endemic species, the world’s largest populations for several others, three endemic sub-species, and a multi-species community that is relatively unique to this ecosystem. Three of the meso-scale physical features of the region are particularly significant to seabirds and cetaceans: the Costa Rica Dome for blue whales and short-beaked common dolphins, the Equatorial Front for planktivorous seabirds, and the countercurrent thermocline ridge for flocking seabirds that associate with mixed-species schools of spotted and spinner dolphins and yellowfin tuna. A few qualitative studies of meso- to macro-scale distribution patterns have indicated that some seabirds and cetaceans have species-specific preferences for surface currents. More common are associations with distinct water masses; these relationships have been quantified for a number of species using several different analytical methods. The mechanisms underlying tropical species–habitat relationships are not well understood, in contrast to a number of higher-latitude systems. This may be due to the fact that physical variables have been used as proxies for prey abundance and distribution in species–habitat research in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Though seasonal and interannual patterns tend to be complex, species–habitat relationships appear to remain relatively stable over time, and distribution patterns co-vary with patterns of preferred habitat for a number of species. The interactions between seasonal and interannual variation in oceanographic conditions with seasonal patterns in the biology of seabirds and cetaceans may account for some of the complexity in species–habitat relationship patterns.

Little work has been done to investigate effects of El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycles on cetaceans, and results of the few studies focusing on oceanic seabirds are complex and not easy to interpret. Although much has been made of the detrimental effects of El Niño events on apex predators, more research is needed to understand the magnitude, and even direction, of these effects on seabirds and cetaceans in space and time.},

Although these studies have produced much valuable data, their small scale restricts the kinds of inferences that can be drawn from them. Maurer then demonstrates how statistical methods can be used to identify processes (such as dispersal or nonrandom extinction) that operate across broad geographic scales, yet which also have profound impacts on local ecosystems.

Regression analysis with a bounded outcome is a common problem in applied statistics. Typical examples include regression models for percentage outcomes and the analysis of ratings that are measured on a bounded scale. In this paper, we consider beta regression, which is a generalization of logit models to situations where the response is continuous on the interval (0,1). Consequently, beta regression is a convenient tool for analyzing percentage responses. The classical approach to fit a beta regression model is to use maximum likelihood estimation with subsequent AIC-based variable selection. As an alternative to this established - yet unstable - approach, we propose a new estimation technique called boosted beta regression. With boosted beta regression estimation and variable selection can be carried out simultaneously in a highly efficient way. Additionally, both the mean and the variance of a percentage response can be modeled using flexible nonlinear covariate effects. As a consequence, the new method accounts for common problems such as overdispersion and non-binomial variance structures.
